# Wildlife Website

This is a project for CS408 showcasing a wildlife website that focuses on accessibility for users who aren't able to fully interact with the website.

Two things that could be added or changed for accessibility could be changing the font choice for the titles, as it could be a bit hard to read, and add extra highlighting/contrast for any buttons or links that are on the page.

## Running this Project

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm -g install http-server
http-server
```
This will launch the webserver, and open a url for you to interact with the website.

I developed this while asking questions to my cousin's cousin, who has been a professional web dev for almost 8 years. I did not share the project or code, but asked how to accomplish specific tasks I was trying to do.
